# Quiz-App
## Description

This is a small Q+A game on a timer for fun! It was built to give an intro to some little aspects of myself in game format and to learn a bit about JavaScript functionality. As such, there's no deep meaning behind it, but I was able to learn a thing or two about implementing an array of objects and referencing them to build sections of div through for loops, which was a pretty exciting thing to explore. Also, creating the loading functionality was particularly rewarding since I was able to piece together, by myself, how to create a system that continued to pull upon itself to effectively update all previous scores and initials to the key/value object pairing in local storage. Baby steps, but it has really helped me think about the steps to create things dynamically through javascript.
